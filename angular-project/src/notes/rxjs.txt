Q.What is uni-cast vs multi-cast?
Ans:Unicasting means that each subscribed observer owns an independent execution of the Observable
Multicasting basically means that one Observable execution is shared among multiple subscriber.

Each subscription execution is different across all subscribers
where as in multicast the execution is shared across all subsribers


Q. What is a subject?
An RxJS Subject is a special type of Observable that allows values to be multicasted to many Observers

    import { Subject } from 'rxjs';
 
    const subject = new Subject<number>();
    
    subject.subscribe({
    next: (v) => console.log(`observerA: ${v}`)
    });
    subject.subscribe({
    next: (v) => console.log(`observerB: ${v}`)
    });
    
    subject.next(1);
    subject.next(2);

    // Logs:
    // observerA: 1
    // observerB: 1
    // observerA: 2
    // observerB: 2
